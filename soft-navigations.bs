Introduction {#sec-intro}
=====================

<div class="non-normative">
<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

A Single Page Application or an SPA is a web application that dynamically rewrites the DOM contents when the user navigates from one piece of content to another, instead of loading a new HTML page.
Development of SPAs has become a common  pattern on the web today. At the same time, browsers haven't been able to measure performance metrics for such sites.
Specifically, JS-driven same-document navigations in SPAs have not been something that browsers detect, and hence went unmeasured.

This specification outlines a heuristic to enable browsers to detect such navigations as Soft Navigations, and report them to the performance timeline and performance observers.
</div>

Task Attribution {#sec-task-attribution-intro}
-----------------

<div class="non-normative">
The above heuristic relies on the ability to track task ancestory and to know that certain tasks were triggered by other tasks.
This specification also outlines a mechanism that would enable user agents to deduce that information, and use it in web exposed features, such as soft navigations.

The user agentâ€™s event loop is continuously running tasks, as well as microtasks.
Being able to keep track of which task initiated which can be valuable in multiple cases:
  * Enable user agents to create heuristics that rely on causal link between one operation (e.g. a user initiated click event) and another (e,g. a DOM modification).
  * Enable user agents to make prioritization (of tasks as well as resource loading) "inheritable", and e.g. ensure that low-priority scripts cannot queue high-priority tasks.
  * Enable causal user activation delegation.
  * Enable accumulating knowledge of resource loading dependency chains, and enable developers to draw insights from them.

</div>

The `SoftNavigationEntry` interface {#sec-interface}
==================================

<pre class=idl>
[Exposed=Window]
interface SoftNavigationEntry : PerformanceEntry {
};
</pre>

Algorithms {#sec-algos}
=====================

<div class=note>
A Soft Navigation is a same document navigation which satisfies the following conditions:
  * Its navigating task is a descendent of a user interaction task.
  * There exists a DOM modification operation whose task is a descendent of the same user interaction task.
    </div>

To <dfn>check soft navigation</dfn>, with a [=Document=] |doc|, run the following steps:
 1. If |doc|'s [=soft navigation same document commit=] is false or |doc|'s [=soft navigation contentful paint=] is false, return.
 1. Let |global| be |doc|'s [=relevant global object=].
 1. Let |entry| be the result of calling [=create a soft navigation entry=] with |global|, |url|, and |start time|.
 1. Call [=emit soft navigation entry=] with |global| and |entry|.

## Soft navigation entry ## {#sec-entry}
To <dfn>create a soft navigation entry</dfn>, with a [=/global object=] |global|, a [=string=] |url|, a {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}} |start time|, run the following steps:
 1. Let |entry| be a new {{SoftNavigationEntry}} object in |global|'s [=global object/realm=].
 1. Set |entry|'s {{PerformanceEntry/name}} to be |url|.
 1. Set |entry|'s {{PerformanceEntry/entryType}} to be "soft-navigation".
 1. Set |entry|'s {{PerformanceEntry/startTime}} to be |start time|.
 1. Let |now| be the [=current high resolution time=] given |global|;
 1. Let |duration| be the [=duration=] between |now| and |start time|.
 1. Set |entry|'s {{PerformanceEntry/duration}} to be |duration|.
 1. Return |entry|.

Note: `id` and `navigationId` are set further down, in [=queue a PerformanceEntry=].


To <dfn>emit soft navigation entry</dfn>, with a [=/global object=] |global|, and a {{SoftNavigationEntry}} |entry|, run the following steps:
 1. [=queue a performanceentry|Queue=] |entry|.
 1. Add |entry| to |global|'s [=performance entry buffer=].
 1. Set |global|'s [=has dispatched scroll event=] and [=has dispatched input event=] to false.
 1. Let |doc| be |global|'s [=associated Document=].
 1. Set |doc|'s [=previously reported paints=] to the empty [=/set=].
 1. Set |doc|'s [=soft navigation same document commit=] and [=soft navigation contentful paint=] to false.


HTML integration {#sec-html}
=================

Document {#sec-html-document}
----------

Each [=document=] has a <dfn for=document>potential soft navigation task id</dfn>, a [=task attribution ID=].

Each [=document=] has a <dfn for=document>soft navigation same document commit</dfn> flag, initially unset.

Each [=document=] has a <dfn for=document>soft navigation contentful paint</dfn> flag, initially unset.

Each [=node=] has a <dfn for=node>modified by soft navigation</dfn> flag, initially unset.

In [=update document for history step application=], add the following steps before 5.5.1 (if `documentsEntryChanged` is true and if `documentIsNew` is false):
 1. Let <a>document</a>'s [=soft navigation same document commit=] be the result of [=Check ancestor for task=]
    with the document's soft navigation ID and the result of calling [=get current task ID=].
 1. Call [=check soft navigation=].

At [=event dispatch=], after step 5.4 ("Let `isActivationEvent` be true..."), add the following step:
 1. If <var ignore>isActivationEvent</var> is true, and <var ignore>event</var>'s [=isTrusted=] is true,
    and |target|'s [=associated Document=] is a [=top-level traversable=], let |target|'s [=associated Document=]'s
    [=potential soft navigation task id=] be the result of calling [=get current task ID=].


At [=node insert=], add these initial steps:
 1. Let |doc| be <var ignore>parent</var>'s [=node document=].
 1. Let |is soft navigation modification| be the result of running [=Check ancestor for task=]
    with the |doc|'s [=potential soft navigation task id=] and the result of calling [=get current task ID=].
 1. Set <var ignore>node</var>'s [=node/modified by soft navigation=] to |is soft navigation modification|.

TODO: multiple interactions require us to keep the task ID here (on the document), not just a boolean.

LCP integration {#sec-lcp-integration}
==========================
In [=potentially add a LargestContentfulPaint entry=], add the following steps:
 1. If <var ignore>element</var>'s [=node/modified by soft navigation=] is true, set |doc|'s [=soft navigation contentful paint=] to true.
 1. Call [=check soft navigation=].

Task Attibution Algorithms {#sec-task-attribution-algorithms}
=========================

<p class=note>
The task attribution algorithms and their integration with HTML are likely to end up integrated into HTML directly.
Integration with other specifications is likely to end up in these specifications directly.
</p>


The general principle behind task attribution is quite simple:
  * Script execution creates a task scope
  * Tasks and microtasks that are queued during a task scope's lifetime are considered its descendents.
  * Certain registered callbacks get an explicit parent task defined. (e.g. the task that registered the callback)

Each task maintains a connection to its parent task, enabling an implicit data structure that enables querying a task to find if another, specific one is its ancestor.


## Task scope ## {#sec-task-scope}


A <dfn id=concept-task-scope>task scope</dfn> is formally defined as a structure.

A [=task scope=] has a <dfn for="task scope">task</dfn>, a [=/task=].

To <dfn>create a task scope</dfn>, given an optional |parent task|, a [=/task=], do the following:
  1. Let |task| be a new [=/task=].
  1. Set |task|'s [=task attribution ID=] to an [=implementation-defined=] unique value.
  1. If |parent task| is provided, set |task|'s [=task/parent task=] to |parent task|.
  1. Let |scope| be a new [=task scope=].
  1. Set |scope|'s [=task scope/task=] to |task|.
  1. Push |scope| to the [=relevant agent=]'s [=agent/event loop=]'s [=task scope stack=].


To <dfn>tear down a task scope</dfn>, do the following:
  1. Pop |scope| from the [=relevant agent=]'s [=agent/event loop=]'s [=task scope stack=]

## Is ancestor ## {#sec-is-ancestor}
To <dfn export>check ancestor for task</dfn>, given |ancestor id|, a [=task attribution ID=], run the following:
  1. Let |task| be the result of [=get current task=].
  1. While true:
    1. Let |id| be|task|'s [=task attribution ID=].
    1. If |id| is unset, return false.
    1. If |id| equals |ancestor id|, return true.
    1. Set |task| to |task|'s [=task/parent task=].

## Is ancestor in set ## {#sec-is-ancestor-in-set}

To <dfn export>check ancestor set for task</dfn>, given |ancestor id set|, a [=task attribution ID=] [=/set=], run the following:
  1. Let |task| be the result of [=get current task=].
  1. While true:
    1. Let |id| be |task|'s [=task attribution ID=] if |task| is set, or be unset otherwise.
    1. If |id| is unset, return false.
    1. If |ancestor id set| [=contains=] |id|, return true.
    1. Set |task| to |task|'s [=task/parent task=].

### Get current task ### {#sec-current-task}
To <dfn export>get current task</dfn>, run the following steps:
  1. Let |event loop| be the [=relevant agent=]'s [=agent/event loop=].
  1. Let |scope| be the result of [=peeking=] into the |event loop|'s [=task scope stack=].
  1. Return |scope|'s [=task scope/task=].

### Get current task ID ### {#sec-current-task-id}
To <dfn export>get current task id</dfn>, run the following steps:
  1. Let |task| be the result of [=getting current task=].
  1. Return |task|'s [=task attribution ID=].

TaskAttribution HTML integration {#sec-task-attribution-integration}
================================

## Task additions  ## {#sec-task}

A [=/task=] has a <dfn for="task">task attribution ID</dfn>, an [=implementation-defined=] value,
representing a unique identifier. It is initially unset.

A [=/task=] has a <dfn for="task">parent task</dfn>, a [=/task=], initially unset.

## Event Loop additions ##{#sec-event-loop}
Each [=/event loop=] has a <dfn>task scope stack</dfn>, a [=stack=] of <a>task scopes</a>.

## Script execution ##{#sec-script}

A [=script=] element has a <dfn for="script">parent task</dfn> [=/task=], initially unset.

In [=prepare the script element=], add an initial step:
 1. Set <var ignore>el</var>'s [=script/parent task=] to the result of running [=get current task=].

Note: The parent task ensures that task creation through the injection of scripts can be properly attributed.

In [=Execute the script element=], add initial steps:
  1. [=Create a task scope=] <var ignore>el</var>'s [=script/parent task=].

Also, add a terminating step:
  1. [=Tear down a task scope=]

## Task queueing ##{#sec-task-queueing}
In [=queue a task=]:

Add these steps after step 3, "Let task be a new task":
  1. Set |task|'s [=task/parent task=] to the result of [=getting current task=].
  1. [=Create a task scope=] with |task|.

Add a terminating step:
  1. [=Tear down a task scope=]

TODO: Do we need this both when queueing a task and when calling a callback?

## Timers ##{#sec-timers}
In [=timer initialisation steps=], before step 8, add the following steps:
  1. Let |parent task| be the result of [=getting current task=].
  1. If |handler| is a Function, set |handler|'s parent task to |parent task|.
  1. Otherwise, [=create a task scope=] with |parent task|..

TODO: How do we properly set the parent task on the callback function??

TODO: need a teardown here for the second case??

## Callbacks ##{#sec-callbacks}
In [=prepare to run a callback=], add the following steps::
  1. Let |task| be <var ignore>callback</var>'s parent task
  1. [=create a task scope=] with |task| if set, and with nothing otherwise.

ISSUE: "prepare to run a callback" is too generic here. It'd be better to call this from more specific places inside the JS hooks and from invoke.

TODO: I don't actually have a callback here! Need to pipe it

TODO: Figure out if we need to do something in particular with the FinalizationRegsitry.

TODO: need a teardown here.

TODO: Need to define registration semantics for everything that doesn't need anything more specific.

<p class=note>
The above is called from both promise continuations and from "regular" script callbacks.
That does not match Chromium where Blink is not notified when promise continuations are run inside of V8.
This is subtly different than what's implemented in Chromium, as there the continuation task overrides
the task stack, where here it pushes a new child task of itself onto that stack.
At the same time, there shouldn't be any functional differences between the two.
</p>


In [=clean up after running a callback=], add the following step:
  1. [=Tear down a task scope=].

## HostMakeJobCallback ##{#sec-hostmakejobcallback}
In [=HostMakeJobCallback=], add the following steps:
  1. Let |task| be the result of [=getting current task=].
  1. Let <var ignore>callable</var>.[task] be |task|.

Note: This is needed to ensure the current task is registered on the promise resolvers when they are created.

## MessagePorts ## {#sec-messageport}

<p class=note>
For message ports, we want the `message` event callback task to have the task that initiated the `postMessage` as its parent.
</p>

In [=message port post message steps=], add the following steps.

Before step 7, which adds a task, add the following steps:
  1. Let |parent task| be the result of [=getting current task=].

In step 7.3, which fires the `messageerror` event, call [=create a task scope=] with |parent task| before firing the event, and [=tear down a task scope=] after firing it..

Before step 7.6, which fires the `message` event, add the following steps:
  1. Call [=create a task scope=] with |parent task|.

After step 7.6, add the following steps:
  1. Call [=tear down a task scope=].

## Same-document navigations ## {#sec-same-document-navigations}
A [=/traversable navigable=] has a <dfn>navigation task</dfn>, a [=/task=], initially unset.

In [=append session history traversal steps=], also set |traversable|'s [=navigation task=] to the result of [=getting current task=].

In [=append session history synchronous navigation steps=], also set |traversable|'s [=navigation task=] to the result of [=getting current task=].

In [=apply the history step=] in step 14.11.2, pass the navigable's task to [=update document for history step application=].

In [=navigate to a fragment=] step 14, pass the result of [=getting current task=].

In [=update document for history step application=], before firing the popstate event in step 5.5.2, [=create a task scope=] with |task|. [=tear down a task scope=] after firing the event.

TODO: more formally define the above.

## View transitions ## {#sec-view-transitions}
In [=startViewTransition()=] add the following initial steps:
  1. Set updateCallback's parent task to the result of [=getting current task=].

Security & privacy considerations {#priv-sec}
===============================================
Exposing Soft Navigations to the performance timeline doesn't have security and privacy implications on its own.
However, reseting the various paint timing entries as a result of a detected soft navigation can have implications,
especially before [visited links are partitioned](https://github.com/kyraseevers/Partitioning-visited-links-history).
As such, exposing such paint operations without partitioning the :visited cache needs to only be done after careful
 analysis of the paint operations in question, to make sure they don't expose the user's history across origins.

Task Attribution as infrastructure doesn't directly expose any data to the web, so it doesn't have any privacy and security implications.
Web exposed specifications that rely on this infrastructure could have such implications. As such, they need to be
individually examined and have those implications outlined.
