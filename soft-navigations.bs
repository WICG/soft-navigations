Introduction {#sec-intro}
=====================

<div class="non-normative">
<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

Single Page App or SPA is a common web development pattern on the web today, but also one that browsers haven't been able to measure performance metrics for.
Specifically, JS-driven same-document navigations in SPAs have not been something that browsers detect, and hence went unmeasured.

This specification outlines a heuristic to enable browsers to detect such navigations as Soft Navigations, and report them to the performance timeline and performance observers.
</div>

Task Attribution {#sec-task-attribution-intro}
-----------------

<div class="non-normative">
The above heuristic relies on the ability to track task ancestory and to know that certain tasks were triggered by other tasks.
This specification also outlines a mechanism that would enable user agents to deduce that information, and use it in web exposed features, such as soft navigations.

The user agentâ€™s event loop is continuously running tasks, as well as microtasks.
Being able to keep track of which task initiated which can be valuable in multiple cases:
  * Enable user agents to create heuristics that rely on causal link between one operation (e.g. a user initiated click event) and another (e,g. a DOM modification).
  * Enable user agents to make prioritization (of tasks as well as resource loading) "inheritable", and e.g. ensure that low-priority scripts cannot queue high-priority tasks.
  * Enable causal user activation delegation.
  * Enable accumulating knowledge of resource loading dependency chains, and enable developers to draw insights from them.

</div>
ISSUE: Should we discuss potential connection with AsyncContext and its use cases?

Algorithms {#sec-algos}
=====================

<div class=note>
A Soft Navigation is a same document navigation which satisfies the following conditions:
  * Its navigating task is a descendent of a user interaction task.
  * There exists a DOM modification operation whose task is a descendent of the same user interaction task.
    </div>

To <dfn>check soft navigation</dfn>, with a [=Document=] |doc|, run the following steps:
* If |doc|'s [=soft navigation same document commit=] is true and |doc|'s [=soft navigation DOM modification=] is true, call [=emit soft navigation entry=] with |doc|.

To <dfn>emit soft navigation entry</dfn>, with a [=Document=] |doc|, run the following steps:

  * Queue an entry
  * Add an entry to the performance timeline
  * Reset LCP flags
  * Reset FP/FCP flags.
  * Reset the doc's flag

TODO: Actually define all the above.

HTML integration {#sec-html}
=================

Document {#sec-html-document}
----------

Each [=document=] has a <dfn for=document>potential soft navigation task id</dfn>, a [=task attribution ID=].

Each [=document=] has a <dfn for=document>soft navigation same document commit</dfn> flag, initially unset.

Each [=document=] has a <dfn for=document>soft navigation DOM modification</dfn> flag, initially unset.

In [=update document for history step application=], add the following steps before 5.5.1 (if `documentsEntryChanged` is true and if `documentIsNew` is false):
* Let <a>document</a>'s [=soft navigation same document commit=] be the result of [=Check ancestor for task=] with the document's soft navigation ID and the result of calling [=get current task ID=].
* Call [=check soft navigation=].

At [=event dispatch=], after step 5.4 ("Let `isActivationEvent` be true..."), add the following step:
* If <var ignore>isActivationEvent</var> is true, and <var ignore>event</var>'s [=isTrusted=] is true, and |target|'s [=associated Document=] is a [=top-level traversable=],
    let |target|'s [=associated Document=]'s [=potential soft navigation task id=] be the result of calling [=get current task ID=].


At [=node insert=], add these initial steps:
* Let |doc| be <var ignore>parent</var>'s [=node document=].
* Let |doc|'s [=soft navigation DOM modification=] be the result of running [=Check ancestor for task=] with the |doc|'s [=potential soft navigation task id=] and the result of calling [=get current task ID=].
* Call [=check soft navigation=].


Task Attibution Algorithms {#sec-task-attribution-algorithms}
=========================

The general principle behind task attribution is quite simple:
  * Script execution creates a task scope
  * Tasks and microtasks that are queued during a task scope's lifetime are considered its descendents.
  * Certain registered callbacks get an explicit parent task defined. (e.g. the task that registered the callback)

Each task maintains a connection to its parent task, enabling an implicit data structure that enables querying a task to find if another, specific one is its ancestor.

## Task scope ## {#sec-task-scope}


A <dfn id=concept-task-scope>task scope</dfn> is formally defined as a structure.

A [=task scope=] has <dfn for="task scope">task continuation data</dfn>, a [=struct=].

A [=task scope=] has a <dfn for="task scope">task</dfn>, a [=/task=].



## Task scope stack ## {#sec-task-scope-stack}
A <dfn>task scope stack</dfn> is a [=stack=] of <a>task scopes</a>.

To <dfn>create a task scope</dfn>, given |task|, a [=/task=], do the following:
  1. Let |scope| be a new [=task scope=].
  1. Set |task|'s [=task attribution ID=] with an [=implementation-defined=] unique value.
  1. Set |scope|'s [=task continuation data=] to SOMETHING!! Push the continuation data on the isolate???
  1. Set |scope|'s [=task scope/task=] to |task|. If |task| is nullptr, create one???
  1. Push |scope| to the [=relevant agent=]'s [=agent/event loop=]'s [=task scope stack=].

To <dfn>tear down a task scope</dfn>, do the following:
  1. Pop |scope| from the [=relevant agent=]'s [=agent/event loop=]'s [=task scope stack=]
  1. Set the isolate's continuation data thing to the one at the top of the stack

## Is ancestor ## {#sec-is-ancestor}
To <dfn export>check ancestor for task</dfn>, given |ancestor id|, a [=task attribution ID=], run the following:
  1. Let |task| be the result of [=get current task=].
  1. While true:
    1. Let |id| be|task|'s [=task attribution ID=].
    1. If |id| is unset, return false.
    1. If |id| equals |ancestor id|, return true.
    1. Set |task| to |task|'s [=parent task=].


## Is ancestor in set ## {#sec-is-ancestor-in-set}

To <dfn export>check ancestor set for task</dfn>, given |ancestor id set|, a [=task attribution ID=] [=/set=], run the following:
  1. Let |task| be the result of [=get current task=].
  1. While true:
    1. Let |id| be |task|'s [=task attribution ID=] if |task| is set, or be unset otherwise.
    1. If |id| is unset, return false.
    1. If |ancestor id set| [=contains=] |id|, return true.
    1. Set |task| to |task|'s [=parent task=].

### Get current task ### {#sec-current-task}
To <dfn export>get current task</dfn>, run the following steps:
  1. Let |scope| be the result of [=popping=] the [=relevant agent=]'s [=agent/event loop=]'s [=task scope stack=].
  1. [=stack/Push=] |scope| to the [=relevant agent=]'s [=agent/event loop=]'s [=task scope stack=].
  1. Return |scope|'s [=task scope/task=].

ISSUE: It'd be better to define a peek operation in infra and use that.

### Get current task ID ### {#sec-current-task-id}
To <dfn export>get current task id</dfn>, run the following steps:
  1. Let |task| be the result of [=getting current task=].
  1. Return |task|'s [=task attribution ID=].

TaskAttribution HTML integration {#sec-task-attribution-integration}
================================

Each [=/event loop=] has a <a>task scope stack</a>.

In [=Execute the script element=], add initial steps:
  1. Let |task| be a new [=/task=].
  1. [=Create a task scope=] with |task|.

Add a terminating step:
  1. [=Tear down a task scope=]

A [=/task=] has a <dfn for="task">task attribution ID</dfn>, an [=implementation-defined=] value,
representing a unique identifier. It is initially unset.

A [=/task=] has a <dfn for="task">parent task</dfn>, a [=/task=], initially unset.

Note: Should we move that info into a "task attribution info" structure and only link those?

In [=queue a task=]:

Add these steps after step 3, "Let task be a new task":
  1. Set |task|'s [=parent task=] to the result of [=get current task ID=].
  2. [=Create a task scope=] with |task|.

Add a terminating step:
  1. [=Tear down a task scope=]

In HostEnqueuePromiseJob add the following steps:
  1. Let |task| be <var ignore>job</var>.|promise|.[task]
  2. Set |task| as the currently running task.

In [=Job-related host hooks=], add the following sub-section.

`HostCreatePromiseResolversCallback (promise)` {#sec-hostcreate-promise-resolvers-callback-html}
----------------------------------------------
Javascript contains an [=implementation-defined=] [=HostCreatePromiseResolversCallback=](promise).
User agents must use the following implementation:
  1. Let |task| be the result of [=get current task id|getting the current task id=].
  1. Let promise.[task] be |task|.

In [=timer initialisation steps=], before step 8, add the following steps:
  1. Let |parentTaskId| be the result of [=getting current task id=].
  2. If |handler| is a Function, set |handler|.|parentTaskId| to |parentTaskId|. Otherwise, [=create a task scope=].

When callbacks are invoked, create a task scope and assign it a parent if the callback has one.

TODO: handle timeouts

TODO: handle postmessages

TODO: handle same document navigations

TODO: other cases?? (rAF, rIC, view transitions, observers, etc)

TaskAttribution ECMA262 integration {#sec-ecma252}
=========================================

In [=CreateResolvingFunctions=] add a step before the final one:
  1. Call [=HostCreatePromiseResolversCallback=] with |promise|.

In [=Jobs and Host Operations to Enqueue Jobs=], add the following subsecion.

`HostCreatePromiseResolversCallback (promise)` {#sec-hostcreate-promise-resolvers-callback-ecma}
----------------------------------------------
The [=host-defined=] abstract operation <dfn>HostCreatePromiseResolversCallback</dfn> takes arguments |promise| (a [=Promise Object=]) and returns nothing.

The default implementation of HostCreatePromiseResolversCallback performs no steps.
ECMAScript [=hosts=] that are not web browsers must use the default implementation of HostCreatePromiseResolversCallback.


Security & privacy considerations {#priv-sec}
===============================================
Exposing Soft Navigations to the performance timeline doesn't have security and privacy implications on its own.
However, reseting the various paint timing entries as a result of a detected soft navigation can have implications, especially before [visited links are partitioned](https://github.com/kyraseevers/Partitioning-visited-links-history). As such, exposing such paint operations without partitioning the :visited cache needs to only be done after careful analysis of the paint operations in question, to make sure they don't expose the user's history across origins.

Task Attribution as infrastructure doesn't directly expose any data to the web, it doesn't have any privacy and security implications.
Web exposed specifications that rely on this infrastructure could have such implications. As such, they need to be individually examined and have those implications outlined.
